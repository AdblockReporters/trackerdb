description: WHO WE ARE
| 
| First, let’s talk about what we’re not.
| 
| We’re not a network that is limited by our size, outdated procedures or our structure. We’re not too proud or stratified to recognize the power of collaboration – in fact, we encourage it. We’re not satisfied with maintaining the status quo because we are already planning for tomorrow’s challenges and innovations.
| 
| We are IPG Mediabrands, a new world agency group designed with dynamic marketing at its core.
| 
| We are 8,500 marketing communication, media and technology specialists in over 130 countries. We are a diverse group of innovators, technologists, designers, scientists, musicians, strategists, buyers, thinkers, planners and mathematicians that are committed to building new solutions for the world’s top brands.
| 
| We are dynamic, empowered and entrepreneurial.
| 
| WHAT WE BELIEVE
| 
| Our network is unified by a shared philosophy we call “Dynamic By Design”. More than just a catch phrase, Dynamic By Design is our commitment to our clients, partners and each other to think and work differently.
| 
| It makes us agile, freeing us from the burdens of old ways of thinking and enabling us to leap into opportunity.
| 
| It breaks down barriers, building a single integrated business where communication and collaboration come as standard.
| 
| It thrives on questions, leaving behind a “set and forget” mentality, embracing adaptation and innovation.
| 
| It helps our clients grow, bringing a better experience and bigger results every time.
