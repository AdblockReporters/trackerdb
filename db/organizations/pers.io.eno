description: "The Tale of Persio
| When we set out to build the Persio platform, we started with an observation. Something big was broken that needed to be fixed. 
| 
| The average retailer had many vendor partners all managing different channels, and they didn't communicate very well with each other. This made it hard to get the personalized message + channel + time + customer equation right. Which was the key to higher conversions. 
| 
| Rather than replacing vendors, Persio was created to integrate them. 
| 
| Persio is a multi-channel marketing and decisioning platform for retail marketers. By interoperating with our client's existing data sources and deployment channels, we help them personalize campaigns across web, email, sms and app from a single interface. 
| 
| Persio. We put control back in the marketer's hands."
