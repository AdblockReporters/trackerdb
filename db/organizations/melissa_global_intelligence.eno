description: Data is one of the most valuable assets you have—accurate, high quality customer data empowers your business to meet all of your customers’ important needs. With good data, you can do business with anyone, anywhere in the world and deliver exactly the experience necessary not only to help drive sales, but to improve loyalty, trade, business intelligence, technology, logistics, and more. But the truth is, all data goes bad (up to 25% per year), whether due to data entry errors or the simple fact that consumers change jobs, move, update email addresses, marry, etc. At Melissa, we help companies harness the value of their Big Data, legacy data, and people data (names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails) to drive insight, maintain data quality, and support global intelligence.
