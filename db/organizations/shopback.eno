description: Conceived by partners who breathe conversion from the early days of the internet it in 1995, ShopBack had the beginning of its development in October 2013. Tired of "sameness" of the market, the idea was just to launch a totally unique and different platform than any the market was already doing.
| 
| Basic premise: our customers invest millions in media a year to bring users to the site, however not one tenth of that investment is aimed at retention of those potential users who visit the site and leave without even a trace.
| 
| Born officially in October 2014, the ShopBack entered the market as an exclusive multi-platform "SaaS" focused on retention, re-engagement and recapture the 98% of users who leave your site without converting. And just after nearly a year of development, we find that we develop a truly exceptional product, so exceptional that was so complex to implement than enough so call Bill Gates (or our dev team) that he could!
| 
| Exactly, if you know any start-up that was born in the perfect present this unprecedented !!
| 
| Realizing this failure, we decided to completely redo this one year of work in 5 months! Time workloads folded, sleepless nights, greasy pizzas in the early hours and there reborn again in February 2015, flying like Romario in 94!
| 
| Extremely easy to deploy and activate up on the site of our grandparents it is possible to do in 5 minutes! We set up a team ready to help them in this and in any setup (if you need), layout and activation platform at no cost! We want to see you as happy as our other customers!
| 
| Anyway, back to our story, the folded loads and sleepless nights continue already greasy pizzas least because we want to be here for you for a long time (replaced by sushi)! But best of all is that every day we think and launch products and solutions unique in the market in order to optimize and increase your conversion rate, because we want our customers sell more!
| 
| There are so many new solutions that often do not our website can keep up our development team! We are the "The Flash" innovation !! So ask the news constantly, please !!
| 
| Join now to our selection of more than 350 customers around the world! Our team is ready to prove to you that yes, we are unlike anything you've ever seen!
