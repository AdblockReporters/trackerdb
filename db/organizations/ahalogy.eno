description: We started developing the Ahalogy technology as internal tools to improve the marketing of one of our previous startups, but once we showed other companies what we were building, we soon learned just how common—and dire—this need was for other brands. So in October 2012 we founded Ahalogy to fix Pinterest marketing for brands and content creators across industries and around the world.
| 
| Along the way Ahalogy has become a fast-growing startup backed by incredible investors. We call Cincinnati home, a city with more brand marketers than any other place in the world. And we've added offices in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Stuttgart to focus on brand, agency, and media partnerships.
