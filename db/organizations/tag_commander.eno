description: Any company’s revenue hinges on its ability to provide its customers with the best possible experience. Advances in digital technology have opened a whole new world of opportunities to optimise their interaction with each client.
| 
| Marketing departments must align themselves with their organisation’s digital transition by adopting a customer-focused approach.
| 
| To build complete customer and prospect profiles, enhanced with every interaction, they need omni-channel and cross-device tracking. To recognise a visitor at the first touchpoint, all their identities must be collated in real time. To optimise campaigns, they must utilise an omni-channel approach to visitor-centric tracking throughout the customer journey. To interact with a customer in an automated and consistent manner, a knowledge and action base that operates in real time is vital.
| 
| Commanders Act stays one step ahead of your needs by natively integrating cross-device identification with a person-focused design, all while complying with privacy laws. Boasting an unrivalled expertise in tag management, Commanders Act provides comprehensive solutions for the collection and activation of its clients’ data.
